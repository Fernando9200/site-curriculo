            In 2016 I started my degree in physics at the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo (UFES), dreaming of becoming a researcher. However, when I studied programming for the first time during one of the course subjects, I ended up falling in love with IT and decided that this was my true vocation. Since then, I have been looking to learn and train myself more and more.
