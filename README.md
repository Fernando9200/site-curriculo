# Portfolio

This is an online portfolio where I describe my skills, education and experience. It's essentially a single-page application made with React.js and bootstrap.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

To start development, you need to clone the GitHub project in a directory of your choice:

```shell
cd "directory of your choice"
git clone https://github.com/Fernando9200/Portfolio.git
```
